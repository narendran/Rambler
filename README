About : 
Rambler is a simple Web Application to store our day-to-day ramblings. Its implemented on DHTML - node.js - mongoDB. I did it with the idea of learning the new technology. And its awesome!

How to use it :
Clone this repository
Change directory to the rambler folder.
Type "./execute"
Go to browser and enter "localhost:10000" in the addressbar
Start rambling! 

Future Directions :
In future, there would be separate ramble channels. 
Like, a separate channel for rambling about life, coding, technology, food. Or even to the extent of specific projects which we carry on as part of our profession.
